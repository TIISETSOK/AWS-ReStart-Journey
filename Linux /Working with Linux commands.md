### `hostname`
> Displays the system's hostname.

```bash
hostname
```

---

### `uptime`
> I used this command to see how long the system has been running.

```bash
uptime
```

---

### `TZ` (Timezone Setting / Variable)
> I used it to view or temporarily change the time zone for the current shell.

```bash
echo $TZ           # View current timezone variable (often empty if using system default)
timedatectl        # View system timezone info (for systemd distros)
```

This only affects the current shell session.

### `cal`
> Displays a calendar.

```bash
cal                # Show current month
cal 2025           # Show full calendar for 2025
cal 06 2025        # Show calendar for June 2025
```

---

### `id`
> Displays user ID, group ID, and group memberships.

```bash
id
```

  ```bash
  man uptime
  ```
