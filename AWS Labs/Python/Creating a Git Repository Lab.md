# Creating a Git Repository

## Overview

* **Git** and **GitHub** complement each other in modern development workflows.
* Creating a Git repository is the initial step in establishing version control for project files.
* A Git repository allows developers to organize code, documents, and assets centrally.
* This setup facilitates collaboration, tracks changes, and maintains a history of modifications.
* Git provides local version control capabilities.
* **GitHub**, a cloud-based platform, enhances collaboration with features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools.
* GitHub runs an instance of git, which is version-control software that runs in the cloud.
* GitHub is popular among open source projects and businesses.

## Topics I will covere in this Lab:

* Download solutions for previous labs.
* Create a GitHub account.
* Read the GitHub Hello World guide.
* Create a private repository for your labs.
* Download your repository.

## Task 1: 

**Here i will be downloading Python Files from Previous Labs**

### Step 1: Accessing the AWS Cloud9 IDE

* I opened the AWS Management Console, and selected the **Cloud9** service.

### Step 2: I opened the AWS Cloud9 Environment

* In the **Environments** section,I selected the `reStart-python-cloud9` card, and chose **Open in Cloud9**.

### Step 3: Downloading the Project

* From the Cloud9 menu bar, I chose **File > Download Project**.
* This downloaded a compressed file containing the lab solutions onto my Pc.
* I extracted the contents of this file for later uploading.

## Task 2: 

**Creating a GitHub Account**

### Step 1: I signed up for a GitHub account.

* Visited `www.github.com` and follow the prompts to create a new GitHub account.

### Step 2: Reviewed the GitHub Account

* i logged in to the new GitHub account and reviewed the personal dashboard and profile.

## Task 3: 

**Reading the GitHub Hello World Guide**

### Step 1: Accessing the Hello World Guide

* After logging in, I accessed the **Hello World** guide provided by GitHub to familiarize myself with the basic repository workflow.

### Step 2: I read the GitHub Hello World Guide

* I followed the **Hello World** exercise to understand core concepts like creating a repository, making commits, and initiating pull requests.

## Task 4:

**Creating a Private Repository**

### Step 1: Create a New Repository

* From the GitHub Dashboard, I selected the **New** button to begin the repository creation process.

### Step 2: I configured Repository Settings.

* I had to set up a private repository using the following configuration:
    * **Repository name**: e.g., `aws_restart` (or another desired name).
    * **Visibility**: I chose **Private** to ensure your work is not publicly accessible.
    * **Initialize**: I checked the box for **Add a README file**.
    

### Step 3: Reviewed the Private Repository

* Navigate to the newly created private repository (`aws_restart`). Confirm that the `README.md` file is present.

### Step 4: Uploaded my Files

* to upload mt files i chose the **Add file ▾ > Upload files** button.
* Uploaded all the Python lab files that you extracted in Task 1.
* Committed the changes to finalize the upload.

---

## Task 5: 

**Downloading a Repository**

### Step 1: Downloaded the ZIP file

* On the main page of your `aws_restart` repository, I chose the **< > Code ▾ > Download ZIP** button.
    
* This saves the repository contents as a `.zip` file to my PC.

### Step 2: Reviewed the Downloaded Files

* I extracted the downloaded `.zip` file to verify that all the files, including the Python lab solutions and the `README.md`, was successfully downloaded from GitHub.

## Conclusions

- GitHub is a platform for hosting code, managing versions, and collaborating on projects.
- Anyone can create a free GitHub account to access tools and contribute to open-source repositories.
- Repositories act as central storage spaces for code, documentation, and project files.
- Private repositories add extra security and privacy by restricting access to sensitive projects.
- You can also download a repository as a ZIP file to work with it offline.
