Networking and Databases

## Things Completed During the Program

## AWS Labs And Core Services Explained

### Compute: 
The purpose of computte is to provide the needed processing power to run applications and workloads.

Enables flexible, cost-effective execution of tasks without managing physical servers.

   • 	For example:

   • 	EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances are virtual servers for scalable computing.

   • 	Lambda instances are serverless compute that runs code in response to events.


### Networking: 

Nectworking concepts are used to connect AWS resources securely and efficiently.
Ensures secure communication between services and with the internet.

• 	For example:

• 	VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) are isolated network environments for your AWS resources.

• 	Route 53 ia a scalable DNS and domain routing service.



### Storage: 

Storage enables the uploading of information to the internet

Supports scalable, durable, and cost-effective data storage

• For example:

• 	S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for backups, media, and static content.

• 	EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.


### Databases: 

Stores and manages structured and unstructured data.

Powers data-driven applications with reliability and scalability

• 	For example:

• 	RDS (Relational Database Service) manages SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL.

• 	DynamoDB it is a NoSQL database for high-performance applications.


### Security:

Security entails how to keep data that is stored on the cloud safe from threats like unauthorised accsess.

For example:

• 	IAM (Identity and Access Management): Controls user access and permissions.

• 	Policies: Define rules for resource access.

• 	Encryption: Protects data at rest and in transit.

• 	Why It Matters: Safeguards your cloud environment against unauthorized access and data breaches.
